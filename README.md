# üèîÔ∏è CodeSherpa: Your AI Guide for Competitive Programming

CodeSherpa is a web application designed to help competitive programmers conquer problems from Codeforces. By providing progressive hints, solutions, and a context-aware AI chatbot, it acts as a guide, helping users learn without simply giving away the answer.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Hints**: Get multiple, progressively more revealing hints for any Codeforces problem.
- **Complete Solutions**: Access a full solution breakdown, including pseudocode, a complete code implementation, and a detailed explanation of the logic.
- **Stunning UI**: A sleek, modern, dark-themed interface designed for a great user experience.
- **Context-Aware Chatbot**: Ask follow-up questions to an AI that understands the specific problem you're working on, providing relevant and insightful guidance.
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically scrapes the problem statement, sample cases, and official editorials from Codeforces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Enter URL**: The user pastes a URL to a Codeforces problem.
2.  **Scrape Data**: The Spring Boot backend uses **Selenium** and **Jsoup** to scrape the problem details and find the official editorial.
3.  **Generate Hints**: The scraped content is sent to the **Fireworks AI** API, which generates a series of hints, a solution, pseudocode, and an explanation based on a carefully engineered prompt.
4.  **Display Results**: The frontend, built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, displays the generated content in a clean, organized, and interactive way.
5.  **Chat with Sherpa**: The user can ask follow-up questions. The chatbot uses the context of the currently displayed problem to have an intelligent conversation, providing clarification and deeper insights.
